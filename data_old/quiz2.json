    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)?",
      "options": [
        "To encrypt all internal traffic by default",
        "To host public-facing services in a buffer network between the internet and LAN",
        "To replace the need for firewalls",
        "To prevent all outbound internet access"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "A DMZ is a segmented zone used to expose services while protecting the internal network."

      "question": "Which principle means users and services should receive only the permissions they need to do their job?",
      "options": [
        "Defense in depth",
        "Least privilege",
        "Implicit trust",
        "Security through obscurity"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Least privilege reduces misuse and limits damage from compromised accounts."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which design concept uses multiple layers of controls (e.g., firewall + EDR + MFA) so a single failure doesn’t lead to compromise?",
      "options": [
        "Defense in depth",
        "Single sign-on (SSO)",
        "Air gapping",
        "Tokenization"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Defense in depth is layered security controls across people, process, and technology."

    {
      "question": "In a zero trust approach, access decisions are typically based on:",
      "options": [
        "Network location alone",
        "Continuous verification of identity, device, and context",
        "A shared admin password for speed",
        "Only the user’s job title"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Zero trust assumes breach; it verifies explicitly with identity/device posture/context signals."

    {
      "question": "Which practice BEST validates that backups will actually help during an incident?",
      "options": [
        "Copy backups to the same disk",
        "Disable backups after they succeed once",
        "Perform restore tests regularly",
        "Store backups only on user laptops"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Backups are only proven when you can restore them; periodic restore testing is essential."
