    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "Why are operational security techniques considered continuous rather than one‑time activities?",
      "options": [
        "Because systems never receive updates",
        "Because threats, software, and configurations constantly change",
        "Because policies require daily audits",
        "Because hardware cannot be secured permanently"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Operational security adapts to changing systems and threats. Policies and hardware alone do not drive this requirement."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "What is the main purpose of secure baselines?",
      "options": [
        "Increase network speed",
        "Provide standardized minimum security configurations",
        "Replace vulnerability scanning",
        "Eliminate the need for monitoring"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Baselines define consistent secure settings; they do not replace scanning or monitoring."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "Which hardening step most directly reduces exposure to remote attacks?",
      "options": [
        "Disabling unused services and closing ports",
        "Increasing log retention",
        "Adding more user accounts",
        "Encrypting backups"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Remote attacks commonly target exposed services and open ports. Logging and backups are important but do not reduce exposure."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "question": "Why are shared Wi‑Fi passwords risky in enterprise environments?",
      "options": [
        "They slow down network speed",
        "They prevent encryption",
        "They make it difficult to revoke access for individuals",
        "They disable intrusion detection"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Individual authentication allows access to be revoked per user. Shared passwords cannot be selectively disabled."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "question": "What is the primary function of wireless monitoring systems?",
      "options": [
        "Improve signal strength",
        "Detect rogue devices and suspicious radio activity",
        "Encrypt wireless traffic",
        "Manage user passwords"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Monitoring identifies unauthorized access points and devices; encryption and authentication are separate controls."

    {
      "id": "q6",
      "question": "Why are web application firewalls used in production environments?",
      "options": [
        "To replace secure coding practices",
        "To detect and block suspicious application traffic",
        "To speed up web responses",
        "To manage user accounts"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "WAFs provide runtime protection but do not replace secure development."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "question": "Which operational role is critical for maintaining application security after deployment?",
      "options": [
        "Only software developers",
        "Operations teams monitoring logs and alerts",
        "Hardware vendors",
        "End users managing permissions"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Operations teams monitor and respond to runtime threats; development alone is not sufficient."
