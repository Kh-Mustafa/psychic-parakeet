    {
      "id": "fsc-q1",
      "question": "Which CIA triad component focuses on ensuring data is not altered without authorization?",
      "options": [
        "Confidentiality",
        "Integrity",
        "Availability",
        "Authentication"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Integrity protects against unauthorized modification. Confidentiality controls access, availability ensures uptime, and authentication verifies identity rather than data correctness."
    },
    {
      "id": "fsc-q2",
      "question": "Which technology MOST directly supports non-repudiation?",
      "options": [
        "Symmetric encryption",
        "Access control lists",
        "Digital signatures",
        "Firewalls"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Digital signatures prove origin and integrity. Symmetric encryption protects confidentiality, ACLs control access, and firewalls filter traffic."
    },
    {
      "id": "fsc-q3",
      "question": "Which authentication factor is represented by a smart card?",
      "options": [
        "Something you know",
        "Something you have",
        "Something you are",
        "Somewhere you are"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Smart cards are physical tokens (something you have). Passwords are something you know, biometrics are something you are, and location-based checks are somewhere you are."
    },
    {
      "id": "fsc-q4",
      "question": "Granting permissions to access specific files is an example of:",
      "options": [
        "Authentication",
        "Authorization",
        "Accounting",
        "Auditing"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Authorization determines what actions are allowed. Authentication verifies identity, accounting records actions, and auditing reviews logs."
    },
    {
      "id": "fsc-q5",
      "question": "Which activity is MOST associated with accounting?",
      "options": [
        "Encrypting data",
        "Reviewing log files",
        "Issuing certificates",
        "Assigning roles"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Accounting focuses on logging and monitoring activity. Encryption protects data, certificates establish trust, and role assignment is authorization."
    },
    {
      "id": "fsc-q6",
      "question": "What is the PRIMARY goal of a security gap analysis?",
      "options": [
        "Detect intrusions",
        "Compare current and desired security states",
        "Enforce compliance rules",
        "Test backup systems"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Gap analysis identifies differences between current posture and target security goals. Detection is monitoring, compliance enforcement is governance, and backups are recovery controls."
    },
    {
      "id": "fsc-q7",
      "question": "Which principle is central to zero trust architecture?",
      "options": [
        "Implicit network trust",
        "Perimeter-based defense",
        "Continuous verification",
        "Shared administrator accounts"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Zero trust requires ongoing verification. Implicit trust and perimeter-only defenses contradict zero trust, and shared admin accounts weaken security."
    },
    {
      "id": "fsc-q8",
      "question": "Which control BEST addresses environmental threats such as fire?",
      "options": [
        "Firewall rules",
        "Intrusion detection systems",
        "Fire suppression systems",
        "Access control lists"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Fire suppression systems mitigate physical hazards. Firewalls and ACLs manage network access, and IDS detects attacks."
    },
    {
      "id": "fsc-q9",
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of honeypots?",
      "options": [
        "Patch vulnerabilities",
        "Mislead and study attackers",
        "Encrypt sensitive data",
        "Block network traffic"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Honeypots are decoy systems used to observe attacker behavior. They do not block traffic, patch systems, or encrypt production data."
    },
    {
      "id": "fsc-q10",
      "question": "Which combination BEST represents the AAA security model?",
      "options": [
        "Authentication, Authorization, Accounting",
        "Availability, Access, Auditing",
        "Authentication, Auditing, Access",
        "Authorization, Availability, Assurance"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "AAA stands for Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting. The other options mix unrelated security concepts."
