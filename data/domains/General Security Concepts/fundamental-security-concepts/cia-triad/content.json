    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to authorized individuals and systems. Controls such as encryption, access controls, and network segmentation are commonly used to protect confidentiality."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Integrity ensures that data is accurate, complete, and has not been altered without authorization. Hashing, digital signatures, and file integrity monitoring help detect unauthorized changes."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed. Redundancy, backups, load balancing, and disaster recovery planning are critical to maintaining availability."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "In real systems, improving one goal may reduce another. Strong encryption improves confidentiality but may reduce availability if key management fails. Security design often involves balancing these tradeoffs."
