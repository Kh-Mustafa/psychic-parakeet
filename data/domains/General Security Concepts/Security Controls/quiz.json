      "question": "A security administrator adds a firewall rule that blocks inbound traffic to an internal management interface from the internet. Which option BEST classifies this control?",
      "options": [
        "Preventive control and technical control",
        "Detective control and technical control",
        "Deterrent control and operational control",
        "Corrective control and managerial control"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The rule blocks access before an attacker can reach the interface (preventive), and it is implemented through a firewall configuration (technical)."

      "question": "A company requires all employees to complete annual security awareness training on handling sensitive information. Which control category BEST fits this requirement?",

        "Operational control",
        "Technical control",
        "Physical control",
        "Preventive control"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Training is carried out by people as part of routine operations, so it is an operational control (category). Preventive is a type, not a category."

        "Detective control",
        "Compensating control"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The sign directs user behavior toward a secure action but does not enforce it, making it a directive control."

      "id": "q5",
      "question": "A critical application has a known vulnerability, but the vendor patch will not be available for two weeks. The team temporarily restricts access using network segmentation rules. What control type BEST describes the segmentation rule in this scenario?",
      "options": [
        "Compensating control",
        "Directive control",
        "Corrective control",
        "Deterrent control"
