      "question": "What is the PRIMARY purpose of cryptography in security systems?",
      "options": [
        "Prevent network attacks",
        "Protect data confidentiality and integrity",
        "Replace access controls",
        "Detect malware"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Cryptography protects confidentiality and integrity. It does not stop attacks, replace access controls, or directly detect malware."

    {
      "id": "cs-q2",
      "question": "Which component issues certificates that bind public keys to identities?",
      "options": [
        "Firewall",
        "Certificate authority",
        "Load balancer",
        "Intrusion detection system"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Certificate authorities validate identities and issue certificates. Firewalls and IDS manage traffic, and load balancers distribute workloads."

    {
      "id": "cs-q3",
      "question": "Why are symmetric keys often used for bulk data encryption?",
      "options": [
        "They are more secure than asymmetric keys",
        "They are faster for large data volumes",
        "They eliminate the need for key exchange",
        "They do not require authentication"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Symmetric encryption is computationally faster. It does not remove the need for key exchange and is not inherently more secure."
    },
    {
      "id": "cs-q4",
      "question": "What is the main role of key exchange protocols?",
      "options": [
        "Encrypt stored files",
        "Securely establish shared secret keys",
        "Verify user identity",
        "Block network traffic"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Key exchange securely establishes shared keys. It does not encrypt files, authenticate users, or block traffic."
    },
    {
      "id": "cs-q5",
      "question": "Which technology is designed to protect cryptographic keys in tamper-resistant hardware?",
      "options": [
        "VPN",
        "HSM",
        "Web proxy",
        "SIEM"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Hardware security modules protect keys in secure hardware. VPNs encrypt traffic, proxies filter requests, and SIEM aggregates logs."

    {
      "id": "cs-q6",
      "question": "Which technique replaces sensitive data with non-sensitive substitutes?",
      "options": [
        "Hashing",
        "Tokenization",
        "Steganography",
        "Key exchange"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Tokenization replaces sensitive values. Hashing produces irreversible digests, steganography hides data, and key exchange negotiates keys."
    },
    {
      "id": "cs-q7",
      "question": "What security property do hash functions primarily support?",
      "options": [
        "Confidentiality",
        "Integrity",
        "Availability",
        "Authentication only"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Hashes detect changes, supporting integrity. They do not encrypt data or guarantee availability or identity alone."
    },
    {
      "id": "cs-q8",
      "question": "Why are hash collisions dangerous?",
      "options": [
        "They expose encryption keys",
        "They allow different data to appear identical",
        "They slow down encryption",
        "They improve authentication"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Collisions allow altered data to appear valid. They do not expose keys, improve security, or affect speed directly."
    },
    {
      "id": "cs-q9",
      "question": "Which statement about blockchain is MOST accurate?",
      "options": [
        "It guarantees confidentiality of stored data",
        "It is only used for cryptocurrency",
        "It provides tamper-evident transaction records",
        "It replaces the need for access controls"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Blockchain provides tamper-evident records. It does not ensure confidentiality, is not limited to cryptocurrency, and does not replace access controls."
    },
    {
      "id": "cs-q10",
      "question": "Why must certificate revocation be supported in PKI systems?",
      "options": [
        "To improve encryption speed",
        "To invalidate compromised or untrusted certificates",
        "To reduce network latency",
        "To eliminate key exchange"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Revocation prevents use of compromised certificates. It does not affect speed, latency, or remove the need for key exchange."
