      "text": "Wireless attacks exploit weaknesses in Wi‑Fi configurations, authentication methods, and user behavior. Because wireless signals extend beyond physical building boundaries, attackers can attempt to compromise networks without ever entering the premises."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Indicators of wireless attacks include unexpected access points detected during scans, users being repeatedly disconnected, or authentication failures across many devices simultaneously. Rogue access points may mimic legitimate network names, tricking users into connecting to attacker‑controlled devices. Once connected, attackers can intercept traffic, inject malicious content, or harvest credentials."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Weak encryption standards or shared passwords increase vulnerability to wireless attacks. Attackers may capture encrypted handshakes and attempt offline password cracking. Indicators of such activity may include repeated deauthentication frames, forcing devices to reconnect so that authentication data can be captured."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Defensive strategies include using strong encryption, enterprise authentication protocols, regular wireless site surveys, and intrusion detection systems that monitor radio frequency activity. Educating users to avoid connecting to unknown networks also reduces risk."
