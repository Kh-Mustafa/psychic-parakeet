      "text": "Domain Name System attacks target the infrastructure responsible for translating human‑readable domain names into IP addresses. Because nearly all network services depend on DNS, successful attacks can redirect users, disrupt services, or provide attackers with covert communication channels."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "One common indicator of DNS attacks is abnormal resolution behavior. Users may be redirected to unfamiliar websites even when entering correct addresses, suggesting DNS spoofing or cache poisoning. Administrators may notice unexpected DNS records or unauthorized changes to zone files. Another warning sign is sudden increases in DNS query volume or unusual query patterns, which may indicate tunneling activity."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "DNS tunneling allows attackers to hide data inside DNS requests and responses, bypassing many firewall restrictions. Because DNS traffic is almost always allowed through network boundaries, attackers can use it as a covert command‑and‑control channel. Indicators include long or random‑looking domain names, consistent query intervals, and traffic to suspicious external DNS servers."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Monitoring DNS logs is critical for identifying these threats. Security teams analyze query frequency, domain reputation, and response behavior to detect anomalies. Preventive measures include DNS security extensions, strict access controls on DNS infrastructure, and blocking known malicious domains through filtering services."
