      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Indicators include spikes in error responses, unusual request sequences, and access attempts to restricted functions. Attackers may automate probing of endpoints to identify vulnerabilities such as injection flaws or authorization bypasses."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Log analysis is essential for detecting application attacks. Security teams look for patterns such as repeated parameter manipulation, unexpected file uploads, or sudden changes in user behavior. Web application firewalls provide additional visibility by flagging suspicious payloads."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Secure development practices, regular testing, and runtime monitoring all contribute to reducing application attack risk. Detection requires close coordination between development, operations, and security teams."
