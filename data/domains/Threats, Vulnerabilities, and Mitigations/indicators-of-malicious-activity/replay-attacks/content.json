      "text": "Replay attacks involve capturing legitimate authentication or transaction data and retransmitting it later to impersonate a valid user or system. These attacks succeed not because encryption is broken, but because systems fail to verify whether messages are fresh or unique."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Indicators of replay attacks may include duplicated transaction records, repeated authentication attempts using identical data, or system logs showing identical tokens being accepted multiple times. In financial systems, replay attacks can lead to duplicated payments or unauthorized transfers."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Systems that rely solely on static credentials or long‑lived session tokens are particularly vulnerable. Without mechanisms such as timestamps, sequence numbers, or cryptographic nonces, servers cannot distinguish between original and replayed messages."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Defensive strategies include enforcing short session lifetimes, validating timestamps, and using challenge‑response authentication methods. Monitoring for duplicate requests or abnormal transaction patterns can help detect replay activity."
