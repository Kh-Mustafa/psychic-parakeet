    {
      "id": "tv-q1",
      "question": "What is the primary difference between an attack vector and an attack surface?",
      "options": [
        "Vectors are tools, surfaces are vulnerabilities",
        "Vectors are methods of entry, surfaces are possible entry points",
        "Vectors apply only to malware, surfaces apply only to networks",
        "There is no difference"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Vectors describe how an attack is delivered, while surfaces describe where attacks could occur. Tools and vulnerabilities are related but not defining differences."

    {
      "id": "tv-q2",
      "question": "Why are message-based attacks effective against many organizations?",
      "options": [
        "They bypass all antivirus software",
        "They exploit trust in communication channels",
        "They require physical access",
        "They only target outdated systems"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Attackers exploit user trust in familiar communication tools. Antivirus can still detect some attacks, and physical access is not required."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv-q3",
      "question": "Which file type is MOST commonly abused to deliver malware through email?",
      "options": [
        "Plain text files",
        "Office documents with macros",
        "Encrypted backups",
        "Configuration files"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Office documents with macros are frequently abused. Plain text cannot execute code, backups are not typically emailed, and configuration files are less common vectors."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv-q4",
      "question": "Why are public wireless networks risky for sensitive communications?",
      "options": [
        "They always contain malware",
        "Traffic may be intercepted or altered",
        "They prevent encryption",
        "They require administrator privileges"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Open networks allow interception. Encryption can still be used, and malware presence is not guaranteed."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv-q5",
      "question": "Which phishing technique specifically targets executives?",
      "options": [
        "Smishing",
        "Vishing",
        "Whaling",
        "Spoofing"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Whaling targets high-level executives. Smishing uses SMS, vishing uses voice, and spoofing is a general impersonation technique."

      "id": "tv-q6",
      "question": "Business email compromise attacks are BEST described as:",
      "options": [
        "Random malware infections",
        "Impersonation and fraud schemes",
        "Network scanning attacks",
        "Password cracking attempts"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "BEC attacks rely on impersonation and fraudulent requests, not technical exploitation or brute-force attacks."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv-q7",
      "question": "What makes watering hole attacks particularly dangerous?",
      "options": [
        "They exploit hardware vulnerabilities",
        "They target sites trusted by victims",
        "They require insider access",
        "They use only zero-day exploits"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Victims trust the infected sites, making detection harder. Hardware flaws and insider access are not required."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv-q8",
      "question": "Why are legacy systems common targets for software-based attacks?",
      "options": [
        "They use stronger encryption",
        "They are often unpatched and unsupported",
        "They are isolated from networks",
        "They require specialized hardware"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Legacy systems often lack patches and vendor support. They are not more secure or isolated by default."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv-q9",
      "question": "Which scenario BEST represents a voice-based social engineering attack?",
      "options": [
        "An email requesting login verification",
        "A phone call posing as IT support",
        "A fake software update website",
        "A compromised USB drive"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Voice attacks occur via phone calls. The other options involve email, web, or physical media."
    },
    {
      "id": "tv-q10",
      "question": "Why are supply chain attacks difficult to detect early?",
      "options": [
        "They use outdated encryption",
        "They originate from trusted vendors",
        "They require insider credentials",
        "They target only physical devices"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Because malicious updates come from trusted sources, security controls may not flag them immediately. Insider credentials and physical-only attacks are not required."
