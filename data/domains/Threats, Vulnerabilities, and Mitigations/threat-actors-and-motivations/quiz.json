    {
      "id": "ta-q1",
      "question": "Why is identifying relevant threat actors important for security planning?",
      "options": [
        "It determines which antivirus software to install",
        "It helps prioritize defenses based on likely attackers",
        "It eliminates the need for monitoring tools",
        "It guarantees attacks will not occur"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Understanding likely attackers helps prioritize defenses. Antivirus choice alone is insufficient, monitoring is still required, and no planning guarantees prevention."

      "id": "ta-q2",
      "question": "Which characteristic is MOST associated with nation-state threat actors?",
      "options": [
        "Short-term financial goals",
        "Limited technical capability",
        "Long-term strategic objectives",
        "Random target selection"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Nation-state actors pursue long-term strategic goals. Financial motives are typical of criminal groups, and nation-states are highly capable and selective in targeting."

    {
      "id": "ta-q3",
      "question": "Which activity is MOST typical of organized cybercrime groups?",
      "options": [
        "Political protest campaigns",
        "Ransomware and data resale",
        "Military intelligence gathering",
        "Academic research"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Organized crime focuses on profit through ransomware and data theft. Political protest is linked to hacktivism, and intelligence gathering aligns with nation-states."
    },
    {
      "id": "ta-q4",
      "question": "What is the PRIMARY objective of hacktivist attacks?",
      "options": [
        "Financial enrichment",
        "Espionage against governments",
        "Public awareness or ideological messaging",
        "Long-term infiltration"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Hacktivists seek visibility and ideological impact. Financial gain and espionage are not their primary goals, and persistence is usually limited."
    },
    {
      "id": "ta-q5",
      "question": "Why are insider threats difficult to detect?",
      "options": [
        "They only use encrypted channels",
        "They operate with legitimate access",
        "They always attack from outside networks",
        "They use zero-day exploits exclusively"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Insiders already have authorized access, making abnormal behavior harder to distinguish. Encryption and zero-days are not defining characteristics."

    {
      "id": "ta-q6",
      "question": "Which scenario BEST represents shadow IT risk?",
      "options": [
        "Employees storing data in unapproved cloud services",
        "Hackers scanning open ports",
        "Administrators installing patches",
        "Firewalls blocking traffic"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Shadow IT involves unapproved systems and services. Port scanning is external threat activity, patching is maintenance, and firewalls are controls."

      "id": "ta-q7",
      "question": "Which motivation is MOST associated with stealing trade secrets?",
      "options": [
        "Sabotage",
        "Espionage",
        "Reputation damage",
        "Service disruption"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Espionage focuses on obtaining sensitive information. Sabotage and disruption aim to damage operations, not steal intellectual property."

    {
      "id": "ta-q8",
      "question": "Which threat actor is MOST likely to use affiliate ransomware programs?",
      "options": [
        "Nation-state groups",
        "Organized crime groups",
        "Hacktivist collectives",
        "Internal employees"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Organized crime frequently uses ransomware-as-a-service models. Nation-states and hacktivists rarely rely on affiliate criminal marketplaces."
    },
    {
      "id": "ta-q9",
      "question": "Which action would MOST likely indicate negligent insider behavior?",
      "options": [
        "Selling credentials on dark markets",
        "Deploying malware intentionally",
        "Reusing weak passwords across systems",
        "Launching denial-of-service attacks"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Negligence includes poor security practices. Selling credentials and malware deployment are malicious acts, while DoS attacks are external."
    },
    {
      "id": "ta-q10",
      "question": "Why might attackers use compromised third-party systems to launch attacks?",
      "options": [
        "To reduce operational costs",
        "To improve attack speed",
        "To hide attribution and origin",
        "To comply with regulations"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Using intermediaries helps attackers avoid attribution. Cost, speed, and compliance are not primary motivations for proxy use."
