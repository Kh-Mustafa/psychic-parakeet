      "text": "Patching is the process of updating software, firmware, and operating systems to fix vulnerabilities and improve stability. It is one of the most direct mitigation techniques because it eliminates known weaknesses before attackers can exploit them. Many successful attacks rely on vulnerabilities that already have available patches but remain unaddressed due to slow update cycles or incomplete asset visibility."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Effective patch management begins with asset inventory. You cannot patch what you do not know exists. Organizations track operating systems, applications, libraries, firmware versions, and even network device software. Once assets are known, patching is guided by risk prioritization. Critical vulnerabilities on exposed systems are patched first, while lower-impact patches may follow scheduled maintenance windows."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Patching carries operational risk. Updates can break applications, introduce compatibility issues, or cause downtime. To manage this, organizations often use staged rollouts: patches are tested in lab or pilot environments, deployed to small groups, monitored for issues, and then rolled out broadly. This reduces the chance that a problematic update causes widespread disruption."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Patch management also includes emergency response. When highly exploited vulnerabilities are disclosed, organizations may need to patch quickly outside normal cycles. In those cases, compensating controls such as firewall rules or temporary isolation may be used while patching is underway. This highlights that patching is part of a broader mitigation strategy rather than a standalone solution."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Finally, patching must include verification. After updates are deployed, systems should be scanned or validated to confirm that vulnerabilities were actually resolved. Without verification, organizations risk believing they are protected when they are not. Continuous monitoring and reporting help ensure patching remains consistent, timely, and aligned with risk."
