      "options": [
        "Increase system performance",

        "Replace patching with monitoring",
        "Disable all network communication"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Hardening reduces exposed functionality and tightens configurations. It does not replace patching and does not require disabling all networking."

      "question": "Which hardening step most directly reduces exposure to remote exploitation?",
      "options": [
        "Forwarding logs to a central server",
        "Disabling unnecessary services and closing unused ports",
        "Increasing storage capacity",
        "Adding more user accounts"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Remote exploitation often targets exposed services and ports. Logging helps detection but does not directly reduce exposure."

        "A process for rotating passwords",

      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Sandboxing isolates execution to limit damage. It is not encryption or firewalling."

        "Replace authentication requirements",

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Isolation is a containment technique. It does not replace authentication or monitoring."

      "question": "Why is asset inventory critical to patching?",
      "options": [
        "It improves encryption strength",
        "You cannot patch systems you do not know exist",
        "It prevents phishing attacks",
        "It removes the need for testing"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Patch management depends on knowing what assets and versions are present. It does not prevent phishing by itself."

        "Disable backups",
        "Allow users to choose their own patch schedules"

      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Staged rollouts reduce the chance that a bad patch affects everyone. Backups should not be disabled."

        "Confirm vulnerabilities are actually resolved",

        "Prevent future vulnerabilities",
        "Replace vulnerability scanning"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Verification ensures patches were applied successfully. It does not prevent future flaws, and scanning may still be used."
