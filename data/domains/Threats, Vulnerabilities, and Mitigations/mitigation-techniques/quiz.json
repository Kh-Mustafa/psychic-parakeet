    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "Why is mitigation considered an ongoing process rather than a one-time task?",
      "options": [
        "Because security tools expire",
        "Because threats and systems continually change",
        "Because policies must be rewritten monthly",
        "Because audits require frequent updates"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Mitigation must evolve as attackers and technologies change. Tools and audits alone do not drive this requirement."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "What is the primary goal of network segmentation?",
      "options": [
        "Improve system performance",
        "Limit lateral movement after compromise",
        "Increase encryption strength",
        "Simplify network design"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Segmentation restricts how far attackers can move once inside a network."

    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "How does microsegmentation differ from traditional segmentation?",
      "options": [
        "It uses physical firewalls only",
        "It applies controls at the workload or service level",
        "It removes the need for authentication",
        "It eliminates network monitoring"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Microsegmentation enforces policies between individual services, not just network zones."

      "id": "q4",
      "question": "Which principle helps prevent excessive user privileges?",
      "options": [
        "Defense in depth",
        "Least privilege",
        "Fail secure",
        "Redundancy"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Least privilege ensures users receive only the access they need."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "question": "Why are access audits important?",
      "options": [
        "They improve encryption",
        "They detect outdated or unnecessary permissions",
        "They replace authentication controls",
        "They reduce network latency"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Audits identify privilege creep and improper access assignments."

      "options": [
        "Define acceptable security settings for systems",
        "Replace vulnerability scanning",
        "Eliminate software updates",
        "Disable unused hardware"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "Baselines define minimum acceptable secure configurations."

    {
      "id": "q7",
      "question": "Why is infrastructure as code beneficial for security?",
      "options": [
        "It removes the need for administrators",
        "It ensures repeatable and auditable configurations",
        "It disables patch management",
        "It reduces authentication requirements"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "Version-controlled templates improve consistency and security enforcement."
