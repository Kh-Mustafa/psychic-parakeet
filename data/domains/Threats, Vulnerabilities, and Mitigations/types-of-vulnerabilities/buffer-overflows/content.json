      "text": "A buffer overflow occurs when a program writes more data to a memory buffer than it was allocated to hold. When this happens, adjacent memory locations may be overwritten, including areas that control program execution. Attackers exploit this behavior to redirect program flow and execute arbitrary code."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Historically, buffer overflows were among the most common and dangerous software vulnerabilities. They are often found in low-level languages that do not perform automatic bounds checking on memory operations. Exploitation can allow attackers to gain full control of vulnerable systems."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Modern systems include protections such as address space layout randomization, stack canaries, and non-executable memory regions. These techniques significantly reduce the success rate of traditional buffer overflow exploits, but they do not eliminate the vulnerability class entirely, especially in older or poorly maintained software."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Even today, buffer overflow vulnerabilities remain relevant in embedded systems, industrial devices, and legacy applications where modern memory protections may not be available or enabled. For this reason, secure coding practices and regular software updates remain essential defensive measures."
