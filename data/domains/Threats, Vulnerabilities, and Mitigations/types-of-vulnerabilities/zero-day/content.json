      "text": "Advanced attackers often discover zero‑day vulnerabilities through independent research or by purchasing exploits from underground markets. These vulnerabilities may be used sparingly to avoid detection."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Indicators of zero‑day exploitation are often indirect, such as unusual system behavior or previously unseen attack patterns. Detection depends heavily on behavioral monitoring and anomaly detection."
