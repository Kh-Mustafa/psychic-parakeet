      "text": "A vulnerability is any weakness that can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems and data. Vulnerabilities are not limited to software bugs; they can also arise from poor configuration choices, flawed business processes, weak physical protections, or even user behavior. From a security perspective, a vulnerability only becomes dangerous when it can realistically be exploited by a threat actor, which is why vulnerability management is always tied to risk assessment."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Organizations rarely suffer breaches because of a single isolated flaw. Instead, attackers often chain multiple weaknesses together. For example, a misconfigured service may expose a management interface, which then allows an attacker to exploit an outdated software component, which finally leads to privilege escalation. This chaining effect is why small configuration errors can have disproportionately large impacts."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Vulnerabilities can exist at every layer of technology, from physical hardware and firmware to operating systems, applications, and cloud services. They can also exist in processes, such as weak approval workflows or inadequate monitoring practices. Treating vulnerabilities as purely technical issues often leaves organizations blind to significant sources of risk."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Because not all vulnerabilities are equally dangerous, security teams prioritize them based on likelihood and impact. A critical vulnerability in an exposed internet-facing service is far more urgent than a low-impact flaw on an isolated internal system. Effective vulnerability management therefore focuses not only on discovery, but also on intelligent prioritization and timely remediation."
