      "text": "Memory injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to insert and execute malicious code directly inside the memory space of a running process. Unlike traditional malware that drops files onto disk, memory-based techniques operate entirely in volatile memory, which makes them harder to detect using file-based antivirus tools. This approach is often referred to as fileless malware."

    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Common memory injection techniques include DLL injection, process hollowing, and reflective loading. In DLL injection, a malicious library is loaded into a legitimate process. Process hollowing replaces the legitimate code of a process with malicious instructions while keeping the original process identity. Reflective loading allows code to load itself without relying on standard system loaders."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "These techniques are popular among advanced attackers because they reduce forensic artifacts and complicate incident response. Since the malicious code disappears when the system reboots, investigators may struggle to reconstruct exactly what occurred unless memory capture or behavioral monitoring was in place at the time of compromise."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Defending against memory injection relies heavily on behavior-based detection, endpoint monitoring, and restricting the ability of processes to inject into one another. Modern operating systems also provide protections such as code signing enforcement and memory isolation, but attackers continually adapt their techniques to bypass these controls."
