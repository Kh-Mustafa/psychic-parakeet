      "text": "Virtualization architecture allows multiple logical systems to run on the same physical hardware by abstracting computing resources through a hypervisor. Instead of dedicating one physical server to one operating system, virtualization enables many virtual machines to share CPU, memory, storage, and networking. This improves hardware utilization and supports rapid provisioning, but it also introduces unique security considerations."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "The hypervisor becomes a critical trust boundary. If an attacker compromises the hypervisor, they may gain control over every virtual machine running on that host. For this reason, hypervisors must be hardened, patched, and monitored just like traditional operating systems. Administrative access to hypervisors should be tightly restricted and protected with strong authentication mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Virtualization also changes how networks are built. Virtual switches and software-defined networking control traffic between virtual machines, sometimes without traffic ever leaving the host. This means traditional network security tools that rely on physical taps or perimeter firewalls may not see internal east–west traffic. Security monitoring must therefore be integrated into virtual networks and hypervisor platforms."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Another concern is virtual machine sprawl. Because creating new virtual machines is easy, environments can quickly accumulate outdated or forgotten systems that are no longer patched or monitored. These unmanaged systems become attractive targets for attackers and increase overall attack surface. Asset management and lifecycle controls are essential in virtualized environments."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Virtualization also supports isolation when configured correctly. Virtual machines are logically separated from one another, reducing the impact of compromise if hypervisor controls remain intact. Snapshots and templated deployments further support recovery and consistency. Effective virtualization security combines hypervisor hardening, network visibility, identity controls, and strong configuration management."
