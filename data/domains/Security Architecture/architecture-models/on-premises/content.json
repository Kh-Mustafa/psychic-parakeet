      "text": "On-premises architecture refers to systems that are physically located within facilities owned or controlled by the organization. Servers, networking equipment, storage systems, and supporting infrastructure are managed directly by internal IT staff or contracted operators. This model offers maximum control over hardware, software, and physical access, but it also places full responsibility for security on the organization."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Security advantages of on-premises environments include the ability to enforce strict physical controls, customize network segmentation, and deploy specialized monitoring tools. Organizations can restrict access to server rooms, control cabling paths, and implement tailored intrusion detection systems. This level of control is often required in highly regulated industries or environments with sensitive intellectual property."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "However, on-premises architecture also introduces significant operational burdens. Organizations must maintain power, cooling, hardware lifecycle management, patching, and disaster recovery capabilities. Security teams must protect against both cyber threats and physical threats such as theft, tampering, and environmental damage. These responsibilities increase cost and complexity, especially as environments scale."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Another challenge is scalability and agility. Deploying new systems typically requires purchasing hardware, installing software, and configuring networks, which takes time and coordination. This slower pace can delay security improvements as well as business initiatives. Additionally, maintaining consistent security configurations across large numbers of physical systems is difficult without strong automation and configuration management practices."
    },
    {
      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Despite these challenges, on-premises architecture remains important for workloads that require low latency, specialized hardware, regulatory isolation, or direct physical control. Security strategies for on-premises environments emphasize layered defenses, strict access controls, robust monitoring, and tested recovery procedures."
