      "text": "Privileged access management further limits exposure by restricting how and when elevated permissions can be used. Administrative sessions may be monitored, recorded, or time-limited to reduce abuse risk."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Remote access introduces additional challenges. Secure access architecture often uses virtual private networks, identity-aware proxies, or zero-trust access gateways to validate users and devices before granting connectivity."

      "type": "paragraph",
      "text": "Effective secure access also includes continuous review of permissions, rapid deprovisioning of departing users, and detection of anomalous access patterns. Access control is not static; it must adapt as organizational roles and systems change."
